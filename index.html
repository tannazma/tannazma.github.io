      <p>
        Recently, I've shifted towards Front-End Development, armed with Vue.js,
        JavaScript, and HTML, and have developed responsive, user-friendly
        websites. Passionate about learning, I'm seeking a front-end role to
        deploy my skills while further expanding my techno-functional palette.
