      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        With a distinctive career navigating SEO, social media, and now
        front-end development, I've honed a broad skillset in the digital
        landscape. <br />
        I've excelled in optimizing web searches and crafting engaging social
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I've shifted towards Front-End Development, armed with Vue.js,
        JavaScript, and HTML, and have developed responsive, user-friendly
        websites. Passionate about learning, I'm seeking a front-end role to
        deploy my skills while further expanding my techno-functional palette.
